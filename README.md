# quadtree
Implementation of quadtree for collision detection in C++ using SFML

Requirements: 1) C++11, 2) SFML 2.5.0, 3) CMake 3.12

The program was tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Xenial, gcc 5.4.0.

Instructions:

1) For an out-of-place build: create a build directory (mkdir build)
2) Change directory to the created build directory (cd build)
3) Create build files with CMake in the build directory (cmake /put/here/path/to/CMakeLists.txt/file)
4) Build the project (e.g. for Unix makefiles it is achieved by using "make" command in the terminal)
5) Launch the executable file "quadtree".
